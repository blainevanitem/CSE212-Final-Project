# Linked Lists
## What is a linked list in python?

In Python, a linked list is a collection of data structures known as nodes. Where the term "linked list" comes from is how the different nodes are setup to be linked together. Each node contains a data value, a head, and a tail. The head of the node points to the node that was placed in front of it and if it is the first in the linked list is classified as the head of the linked list. Likewise, the tail is the last node in the linked list. 

Common functions for this data set are changing the head or tail, as well as removing a node from the linked list. When removing a node from a linked list you have to remove both the connection between the node before it and after it. Then you update the next and previous pointers.

# **CSE212-Final-Project Outline**
This will be the outline going over the different portions of the Final Project. The basics of what the project needs to include are:

1. Select one of the following: stack, queue
2. Select one of the following: set, linked list
3. You must include the following: tree

# The different parts of the project will be:
- ## Welcome
    - Introduction:
        - What the tutorial will be going over in detail. The data structures that will be presented so they can easily move to the section that they want to go to.
    - Table of Contents:
        - This is where I will place links to different example files so it will be easy for them to navigate.
        - **Example** : [README file](README.md)
- ## Queue
    - Introduction:
        - Describe what a Queue is, provide a visual of what it could be.
        ![Queue](images/queue_example.png)
            - Also give link to the code example to easily navigate there
                                    - [Queue Python Example](1-queue.py)
        - I can use some information found here [Queue Lesson](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse212-course/lesson07/07-prepare.html#1.1)
- ## Linked Lists
    - Introduction
        - Describe what a Linked List is, provide a visual of what it could be. [Linked List Lesson](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse212-course/lesson04/04-prepare.html#1.4)
                ![Linked List](images/linked_list.jpeg)
                    - Also give link to the code example to easily navigate there
                        - [Linked List Python Example](2-linked_list.py)
        - Also give an example of Double Linked List:
                ![Double Linked List](images/linked_list_double.jpeg)
    - Inserting into a linked list:
        - [Linked List Insert](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse212-course/lesson07/07-prepare.html#1.2)
    - Removing from a linked list: 
        - [Linked List Remove](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse212-course/lesson07/07-prepare.html#1.3)
    - Accessing items in a linked list:
        - [Linked List Access](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse212-course/lesson07/07-prepare.html#1.4)

- ## Trees
    - Introduction
        - Describe what a Tree is, provide a visual of what it could be. [Tree Lesson](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse212-course/lesson09/09-prepare.html)
                ![Linked List](images/binary_search_tree.png)
                    - Also give link to the code example to easily navigate there:
                        - [Tree Python Example](3-trees.py)
    - Inserting into a Binary Search Tree:
        - [Binary Search Tree Insert](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse212-course/lesson09/09-prepare.html#1.4)
    - Removing from a linked list: 
        - [Binary Search Tree Traverse](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse212-course/lesson09/09-prepare.html#1.5)

The best way to learn is to code it yourself. For the problem you will have to ...

After working through it you can compare your solution to the file here: [Trees Python Solution](3-trees.py)

<!-- You should have an example problem that you propose and then help the student walk through to the solution.
You should also have a problem that the student solves (with a link to your solution). It looks like your example problem file is empty at this point. -->
